Project Title: Sentimental Analysis for Monarchy in UK

Sentiment analysis is a study of subjective information present in any form of data which will give out different expressions used in any particular statement. Automating such a process gives out deep hidden insights on the data which is possible only with Natural Language Processing.
Our main goal is to find out sentiment analysis on how people reacted to the recent event ‘Queen Elizabeth II death’ and if possible find the most probable issues that might rise in the future. 
This project can be used for any particular event that occurs around the world and see how people are reacting to it. The expressions of people can be evaluated to see how the country/company is going to progress further in the future.
The benefit of knowing things early can be taken as a precaution and avoid it totally which can turn over a catastrophe. This project can be contributed towards Artificial intelligence and further improve
